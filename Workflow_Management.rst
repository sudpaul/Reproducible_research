**Workflow Management**

Workflow management systems help distribute and orchestrate the work that needs to be done on 
the computational resources that are available, but also helps in tracking provenance of the 
results, by storing details of the data, the process, and the executions that take place during the analysis.

**Code Construction Workflow**

Creating and executing your code follows two different workflow patterns.

- Create code in a text file and execute it with favorite IDE
- Create code in a text file and import it as a library/packages

Generally speaking, developers do both. The difference between importing and execution is subtle.

With either of these workflows, you create your code in as modular a fashion as possible and, during the creation process, 
you execute it in one of the methods described above to check it’s working. 
Most Software developers are back and forth between their terminal and the editor, and can do fine grained testing of every 
single line of code as they’re writing it.
